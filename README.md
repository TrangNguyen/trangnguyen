=========================================

IDEAS
-----
* A Grunt Angular project without Requirejs. 
* grunt-contrib-connect to serve small web server in development
* SASS to handle CSS and Styling
* Extract styles of coding and code organization from different projects, including [angular-app](https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app), [ngStart](https://github.com/marcorinck/ngStart)
* [videogular](https://github.com/2fdevs/videogular) for hosting video. Wrapped in custom directive for multiple instances and text-link to cue points.
* Using [duScroll](http://oblador.github.io/angular-scroll/) for scrolling, with custom function to handle hash routing.

TODO
